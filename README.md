# GitHub-Finder
I love GitHub, it's such a fantastic idea us developers use everyday. So when I found GitHubâ€™s API I knew I wanted to use the data for a project. My GitHub Profile finder lets you type in any user and displays their profile information including followers, forks, stars, watchers and their latest 5 repositories.
